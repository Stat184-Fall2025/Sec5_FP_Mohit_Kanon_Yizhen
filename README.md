# Analyzing Stocks Using the Moving Average Crossover Strategy
Our repo is to show viewers how our project works, and the base code that was used to to create it. We will show others how we created our code that shows how stocks change over time through data visualizations, and we will present our findings on the Moving Average Crossover technique. 

## Overview
Our projects purpose is to select popular stocks from yahoo finance and accurately represent the data collected in a way that makes it easier to understand, and use the Moving Average Crossover technique to provide stock price trends. Our goal is to explain the data in a way that makes the reader understand the visuals of the overall stock and use the Moving Average Crossover technique to predict stock price trends. 

## Interesting Insight:

Here we can see an rough outline of how our moving average crossover would look like on a graph

Current Plan
Each members will write codes using datas about stock from the website and make a presentation. Repo Structure Use this section to explain the structure of your repo. This should help visitors quickly figure out where they should look to find certain elements. Further, you can use this space to highlight and briefly explain important/key files in the repo.
