# Title
Our repo is to show viewers how our project works, and the base code that was used to to create it. We will show others how we created our code that shows how stocks change over time through data visualizations. 

## Overview
Expand on those introductory sentences with a brief but informative description of your project's purpose and goals. This section should help visitors decide whether they should dig deeper into your repo/project.

##Interesting Insight (Optional)
This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with {ggplot2} by using the function ggsave.

Current Plan
Each members will write codes using datas about stock from the website and make a presentation. Repo Structure Use this section to explain the structure of your repo. This should help visitors quickly figure out where they should look to find certain elements. Further, you can use this space to highlight and briefly explain important/key files in the repo.
